# AI-Based Student Performance Prediction System
## AI/ML Internship Graduate Project

### About This Project
This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits. It has been built with two ways to explore the code: through interactive **Jupyter Notebooks** and a standalone **Flask Web Application**.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Option A: Run the Web App (Easiest)
Just run this command in your terminal:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open: `http://localhost:5000`

### Option B: Use Jupyter Notebooks
1. Open **`notebooks/Student_Performance_System.ipynb`** to see the 7-module ML pipeline.
2. Open **`notebooks/Web_App_Launcher.ipynb`** if you prefer to launch the website from within Jupyter.
